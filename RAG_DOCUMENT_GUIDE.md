## üöÄ Upload Strategy

## üìà Monitoring Document Effectiveness

Track these metrics to improve document quality:

1. **Query Success Rate**: Are users getting answers?
2. **Source Citations**: Which documents are referenced most?
3. **User Feedback**: Are answers accurate and helpful?
4. **Coverage Gaps**: What questions can't be answered?

### Improving Based on Gaps

If users ask questions that can't be answered:
1. Identify the missing information
2. Create or update relevant documents
3. Re-upload with better structure
4. Monitor improvement

## üîí Security Considerations

### What NOT to Upload

‚ùå **Do not upload documents containing:**
- Personal Identifiable Information (PII)
- Passwords or credentials
- Confidential financial data
- Customer data
- Trade secrets
- Unreleased product information
- Legal privileged information

### What TO Upload

‚úÖ **Safe to upload:**
- Anonymized examples
- Process descriptions
- Public policies
- Training materials
- General procedures
- Framework documentation

### Data Masking

Before uploading, mask sensitive data:
- Replace names with roles: "CFO" instead of "John Smith"
- Use generic examples: "$X amount" instead of actual figures
- Remove account numbers
- Remove email addresses (use roles instead)

## üìû Document Maintenance

### Regular Review Schedule

- **Monthly**: Review usage statistics
- **Quarterly**: Update documents with changes
- **Annually**: Archive outdated documents

### Version Control

When updating documents:
1. Increment version number
2. Note changes in document
3. Re-upload with new version
4. Remove old version if outdated

### Retirement Process

When retiring documents:
1. Archive rather than delete
2. Update any references
3. Add redirect information
4. Notify users of changes

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Use Consistent Naming**: `[Application]_[Type]_[Topic]_v[Version].pdf`
   - Example: `eControls_SOP_ReviewProcess_v2.1.pdf`

2. **Add Timestamps**: Include "Last Updated: [Date]" in documents

3. **Cross-Reference**: Link related documents together

4. **Include Examples**: Real-world examples improve understanding

5. **Keep it Current**: Outdated docs are worse than no docs

6. **Test Queries**: After uploading, test if chatbot can answer key questions

7. **Iterate**: Continuously improve based on user feedback

## üìã Upload Checklist

Before clicking "Upload":

- [ ] Document is in correct format (PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT)

## üéì Training Your Users

4. **Feedback**: Collect user input on quality
5. **Iterate**: Improve based on feedback
