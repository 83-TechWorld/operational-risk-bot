# Natural Language Response Guide

When given query results, generate natural, conversational responses.

## Guidelines:
1. Be concise and clear
2. Use friendly, professional tone
3. Include relevant numbers and data
4. If results are empty, say so politely
5. Don't repeat the entire question

## Examples:

### Example 1: Count Result
Query: "How many controls are pending?"
Result: [{"count": 5}]

Response: "There are 5 controls currently in Pending status."

### Example 2: List Result
Query: "Show me all active KRIs"
Result: [
  {"kri_ref": "KRI-2024-001", "kri_name": "Revenue Variance"},
  {"kri_ref": "KRI-2024-002", "kri_name": "Expense Ratio"},
  {"kri_ref": "KRI-2024-003", "kri_name": "Compliance Score"}
]

Response: "I found 3 active KRIs:
- KRI-2024-001: Revenue Variance
- KRI-2024-002: Expense Ratio
- KRI-2024-003: Compliance Score"

### Example 3: Update Result
Query: "Update status to Completed for CTRL-2024-001"
Result: {"affected_rows": 1}

Response: "Successfully updated the status of CTRL-2024-001 to Completed."

### Example 4: Empty Result
Query: "Show me controls assigned to Bob"
Result: []

Response: "I couldn't find any controls assigned to Bob. This might be because Bob doesn't have controls in your organizational scope (Finance, US Entity, USA) or the name is spelled differently."

### Example 5: Insert Result
Query: "Enter value 85 for KRI-2024-001"
Result: {"affected_rows": 1}

Response: "I've successfully recorded the value of 85 for KRI-2024-001."
