## Coding Standards

### Java (Backend)

**Naming Conventions:**
```java
// Classes: PascalCase
public class InterviewService { }

// Methods: camelCase
public void createInterview() { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
private static final int MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3;

// Variables: camelCase
private String candidateName;
```

**Code Style:**
```java
// Always use braces
if (condition) {
    doSomething();
}

// Keep methods focused and short (<50 lines)
public void processInterview() {
    validateCandidate();
    generateQuestions();
    evaluateAnswers();
}

// Use meaningful names
// Bad: int d;
// Good: int daysUntilInterview;
```

**JavaDoc:**
```java
/**
 * Creates a new interview session for a candidate.
 *
 * @param request the interview creation request
 * @param resume the candidate's resume file
 * @param createdBy the HR user creating the session
 * @return the created interview session details
 * @throws InterviewException if candidate is in cooldown period
 */
public InterviewSession createSession(CreateRequest request, 
                                     MultipartFile resume, 
                                     String createdBy) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### JavaScript/React (Frontend)

**Component Structure:**
```javascript
// Functional components with hooks
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ prop1, prop2 }) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Effect logic
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  const handleEvent = () => {
    // Event handler
  };
  
  return (
    <div>
      {/* JSX */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

**Naming Conventions:**
```javascript
// Components: PascalCase
const InterviewDashboard = () => { }

// Functions: camelCase
const handleSubmit = () => { }

// Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
const MAX_QUESTIONS = 15;

// Files: kebab-case
interview-dashboard.jsx
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Backend Tests

```java
@SpringBootTest
class InterviewServiceTest {
    
    @Autowired
    private InterviewService interviewService;
    
    @Test
    void shouldCreateInterviewSession() {
        // Arrange
        CreateRequest request = new CreateRequest();
        request.setCandidateName("John Doe");
        
        // Act
        InterviewSession session = interviewService.createSession(request);
        
        // Assert
        assertNotNull(session);
        assertEquals("John Doe", session.getCandidate().getFullName());
    }
    
    @Test
    void shouldThrowExceptionWhenCandidateInCooldown() {
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Frontend Tests

```javascript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import InterviewForm from './InterviewForm';

describe('InterviewForm', () => {
  test('renders form fields', () => {
    render(<InterviewForm />);
    expect(screen.getByLabelText('Candidate Name')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
  
  test('submits form with valid data', async () => {
    const handleSubmit = jest.fn();
    render(<InterviewForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />);
    
    fireEvent.change(screen.getByLabelText('Candidate Name'), {
      target: { value: 'John Doe' }
    });
    
    fireEvent.click(screen.getByText('Submit'));
    
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(handleSubmit).toHaveBeenCalled();
    });
  });
});
```

# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to **security@yourcompany.com**.

### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue
- How you think the issue should be mitigated

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: Within 7 days
  - High: Within 30 days
  - Medium: Within 90 days
  - Low: Best effort

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report:

1. We confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. We audit code to find similar problems
3. We prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. We release patches as soon as possible

### Security Measures in Place

#### Authentication & Authorization

- SSO integration with OAuth2
- Session token-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Token expiration and rotation

#### Data Protection

- Encrypted data transmission (HTTPS/TLS)
- Secure password storage (if applicable)
- File upload validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (JPA/Hibernate)

#### API Security

- Rate limiting
- CORS configuration
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Request size limits

#### Infrastructure

- Regular dependency updates
- Security scanning (Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check)
- Container security (if using Docker)
- Database encryption at rest

### Security Best Practices for Contributors

#### Code Review

- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Security-focused code review checklist
- Automated security scanning in CI/CD

#### Dependencies

- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Review dependency licenses
- Scan for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency lock files

#### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to repository
- Use environment variables
- Use secret management tools (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate secrets regularly

#### Input Validation

```java
// Always validate user input
@Valid
public ResponseEntity<Interview> createInterview(@RequestBody @Valid CreateRequest request) {
    // Validation happens automatically
}

// Sanitize file uploads
if (!isValidFileType(file)) {
    throw new InvalidFileException("Invalid file type");
}
```

#### SQL Injection Prevention

```java
// Use JPA/Hibernate parameterized queries
@Query("SELECT c FROM Candidate c WHERE c.email = :email")
Optional<Candidate> findByEmail(@Param("email") String email);

// Never concatenate SQL strings
// DON'T DO THIS: "SELECT * FROM candidates WHERE email = '" + email + "'"
```

#### XSS Prevention

```javascript
// React automatically escapes output
<div>{userInput}</div> // Safe

// Be careful with dangerouslySetInnerHTML
// Only use with sanitized content
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
<div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: DOMPurify.sanitize(html) }} />
```

### Known Security Considerations

#### File Uploads

- Maximum file size: 10MB
- Allowed types: PDF, DOC, DOCX
- Files are scanned before processing
- Stored in secure location

#### Session Management

- Session tokens are UUID-based
- Tokens expire after interview completion
- One active session per candidate
- Session hijacking prevention

#### Rate Limiting

- API endpoints are rate-limited
- Prevents brute force attacks
- Protects against DDoS

### Security Checklist for Developers

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] Input validation implemented
- [ ] Output encoding used
- [ ] Authentication required for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Authorization checks in place
- [ ] HTTPS used for all communications
- [ ] Dependencies are up-to-date
